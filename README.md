# üß† Max-Cut Approximation via Semidefinite Programming (UGP Project)

This repository contains the implementation and analysis of the Goemans-Williamson approximation algorithm for the Max-Cut problem. The project was carried out as part of my Undergraduate Research Project (UGP) at IIT Kanpur, focusing on relaxation-based approximation methods and convex optimization.

## üìå Project Overview

- **Objective**: Study approximation algorithms using relaxation techniques, with a focus on semidefinite programming (SDP) and its application to the Max-Cut problem.
- **Approach**: Implement the Goemans-Williamson algorithm using convex optimization and analyze the performance with respect to brute-force and theoretical bounds.
- **Impact**: Developed a strong understanding of the trade-offs between exact and relaxed solutions, improved algorithmic efficiency by optimizing bottlenecks, and enhanced implementation skills with numerical solvers.
